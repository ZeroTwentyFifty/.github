Getting support from ZeroTwentyFifty

We use the GitHub issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests only. 

If what you'd like to do is best described as a bug report or a code contribution then you should submit a GitHub issue or pull request as usual.

Please see our Notes for ZeroTwentyFifty Contributors for how to file a bug report, our contributor checklist and other helpful information.

But if you have come here for help, commercial support with our solutions or consultancy services, or if you are unsure whether the behavior you're experiencing is a bug, then you should see our website zerotwentyfifty.com/services or contact us directly at contact@zerotwentyfifty.com
